# Paper-Toss-AI
Remade the 2009 game Paper Toss and crafted a custom AI to learn it in Unity &amp; C#.
Pretty fun project, but I want to incorporate ML-agents and Tensorflow to see which is better / more efficient.

Instructions for importing into your project:
 - Load the contents of the Assets folder into your new Unity project assets folder.
 - Open up the scene AI_Scene
 - Optional (Change the timescale in Edit/Project Settings/Time) for faster AI training.


The bulk of this code was written by me, but the instructions for the AI script can be found at:
